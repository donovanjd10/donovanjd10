## Hi there, I'm Donovan. 👋

Software Developer | Engineering Tech Background | Secret Clearance Eligible

I am a Software Developer based in Idaho (Open to Relocation). I specialize in bridging the gap between hardware realities and software solutions.

Currently, I am building full-stack applications with Foundry, and doing backend development for a custom chat bot at Selkirk Sport, while finishing my BS in Computer Science at WGU.



🛡️ Why Me?

My path to software wasn't linear — and that's my advantage.

Hardware Roots: My time at Digital Force Technologies and Embry-Riddle gave me a deep understanding of electro-optical systems, sensors, and physical engineering.

Software Execution: I don't just write code; I build systems that solve business problems, from Palantir Foundry integrations to Python automations that save thousands in operational costs.

Defense Ready: I understand the rigor required for defense & aerospace applications and I am Secret Clearance Eligible (Until ~June 2026).



🛠️ Technical Stack

Languages: TypeScript, C++, Python.

Platforms & Tools: Palantir Foundry, Supabase, Azure Container Apps, Redis.

Hardware & Interests: Embedded and IoT Devices, Robotics, Defense systems, Meshtastic devices, Proof of Work Cryptography & Mining



🔭 What I'm Working On

Warehouse Optimization Algorithms: Developing logic to optimize pick-paths utilizing pack and pass picking, order/printer queueing and automating shipping method selection using TypeScript (Palantir Foundry).

Microcontroller Integration: At home, I'm currently experimenting with ESP32 modules for bitcoin mining, custom mesh communication devices, and a custom game controller.

WGU: Currently working on Operating Systems.



🎓 Education

BS Computer Science | Western Governors University (Expected 2026)

AS Engineering Fundamentals | Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University

BS Economics | Eastern Washington University
